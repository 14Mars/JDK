Introduction

     Thank you for downloading this release of the Java(TM) 2 SDK,
     Standard Edition. The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for
     building applications, applets, and components that can be
     deployed on the Java platform.

     The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
     testing programs written in the Java programming language and
     running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used
     from the command line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not
     provide a graphical user interface.

     The release comes with the Java Plug-in product as part of the 
     Java 2 Runtime Environment. You can use the Java Plug-in product 
     to enable browsers to run applets based on the Java 2 Platform. 
     For more information about the Java Plug-in product, see the 
     section titled "Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java Plug-in" in 
     the README.html file.

Demos

     A demo directory is included in this software bundle with a
     variety of applets, Swing applications, and other examples for 
     you to try out. The demos come with complete source code.


Java 2 SDK Documentation

     The on-line Java 2 SDK Documentation contains API specifications,
     developer guides, tool reference pages, demos, and links to
     related information. It is located at

     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/

     The Java 2 SDK documentation is also available in a download bundle 
     which you can install locally with your Java 2 SDK software. See the 
     Java 2 SDK download page: 
     
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs.html


System Requirements

     This version of the Java 2 SDK is supported on Intel Pentium 
     platform running the Linux kernel v 2.2.12 and glibc v 2.1.2. A 
     minimum of 32 megabytes RAM are required. Recommended 48 megabytes 
     of RAM, 16-bit color mode, KDE and KWM window managers. Sun 
     Microsystems, Inc. has tested this release using Red Hat Linux 6.1. 

     Check your version of glibc using the following command: 

         ls /lib/libc-*

     The output of this command should show libc-2.1.2.so or higher.  

     You should have about 75 megabytes of free disk space before 
     attempting to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install 
     the separate documentation download bundle, you need an additional 
     125 megabytes of free disk space.
